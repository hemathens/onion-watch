# Enhanced Onion Quality AI Prediction Integration

This document explains the improved AI prediction system that provides accurate, research-based onion lifespan predictions.

## Major Improvements (v2.0)

### Enhanced Accuracy System
The AI prediction system has been completely redesigned with scientific storage research and realistic shelf-life calculations:

- **Extended Shelf-Life Range**: Now predicts 1-180 days (previously 1-60 days)
- **Deterioration Index**: Uses 0-100% deterioration scale for precise assessment
- **Environmental Adjustments**: Seasonal and variety-based corrections
- **Research-Based Grading**: Aligned with real onion storage science

### Key Features

#### Real AI Model Integration
- **Teachable Machine Model**: Uses pre-trained model with "Healthy" and "Spoiled" classifications
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Converts binary classification to detailed deterioration assessment
- **Batch Analysis**: Processes multiple images with comprehensive reporting
- **Real-time Results**: Immediate feedback with detailed quality metrics

#### Scientific Quality Assessment
- **Deterioration Index (0-100%)**: Scientific measurement of onion condition
- **Realistic Shelf-Life**: Based on commercial storage research:
  - Grade A: 120-180 days (≤15% deterioration)
  - Grade B: 60-90 days (15-30% deterioration) 
  - Grade C: 20-45 days (30-50% deterioration)
  - Grade D: 7-15 days (50-70% deterioration)
  - Grade F: 1-7 days (≥70% deterioration)
- **Variety Detection**: Automatic estimation of storage vs. sweet/red varieties
- **Environmental Factors**: Seasonal adjustments for accurate predictions

#### Enhanced User Interface
- **Detailed Metrics Display**: Visual deterioration index with progress bars
- **Variety Information**: Shows estimated onion type and storage characteristics
- **Organized Recommendations**: Categorized by immediate, storage, and monitoring
- **Environmental Context**: Shows seasonal adjustments applied to predictions

## Technical Implementation

### AI Service (`src/services/aiPredictionService.ts`)
```typescript
// Key methods:
- loadModel(): Loads the Teachable Machine model
- predictFromFile(file): Analyzes a single image file
- analyzeBatch(files): Processes multiple images
- convertToOnionAnalysis(): Converts raw predictions to structured analysis
```

### Model Files
- **Location**: `public/onion-model-main/my_model/`
- **Files**: 
  - `model.json`: Model architecture
  - `metadata.json`: Model metadata and labels
  - `weights.bin`: Trained model weights

### Integration Points
1. **HTML Head**: Includes TensorFlow.js and Teachable Machine libraries
2. **Predictions Page**: Uses the AI service for real-time analysis
3. **Inventory Context**: Receives analyzed batch data with AI metrics
4. **Dashboard**: Displays AI-generated quality scores and status

## Model Training Details

### Classification Labels
- **Healthy**: Good quality onions suitable for storage
- **Spoiled**: Poor quality onions requiring immediate attention

### Model Specifications
- **Input Size**: 224x224 pixels
- **Model Type**: Image classification
- **Framework**: TensorFlow.js with Teachable Machine
- **Version**: Compatible with TensorFlow.js 1.3.1+

## Enhanced Quality Mapping Algorithm

### Deterioration-Based Analysis
```typescript
// New scientific approach based on deterioration index
if (deteriorationIndex <= 15) → Grade A (120-180 days)
if (deteriorationIndex <= 30) → Grade B (60-90 days)
if (deteriorationIndex <= 50) → Grade C (20-45 days)
if (deteriorationIndex <= 70) → Grade D (7-15 days)
if (deteriorationIndex > 70) → Grade F (1-7 days)
```

### Environmental Adjustments
- **Harvest Season (Aug-Oct)**: +20% shelf life extension
- **Winter Storage (Nov-Feb)**: +10% for optimal conditions
- **Spring/Summer (Mar-Jul)**: -15% for warm weather challenges
- **Variety Corrections**: Storage varieties get +15%, sweet/red get -20%

### Enhanced Interface Features
```typescript
interface OnionAnalysis {
  // ... existing properties
  deteriorationIndex: number;        // 0-100% deterioration
  varietyEstimate: 'storage' | 'sweet' | 'red' | 'unknown';
  storageRecommendations: string[];  // Specific storage guidance
  environmentalFactors: {
    season: string;
    adjustmentApplied: number;       // Percentage adjustment
  };
}
```

## Usage Workflow

1. **Upload Images**: Drag & drop or select onion batch photos
2. **AI Analysis**: Click "Analyze with AI" to process images
3. **Review Results**: See quality grades, confidence scores, and recommendations
4. **Save to Inventory**: Add analyzed batch to inventory with AI metadata
5. **Monitor Dashboard**: Track AI-analyzed batches in main dashboard

## Error Handling

### Model Loading Failures
- Falls back to manual analysis mode
- Shows clear error messages to users
- Provides alternative workflow options

### Image Processing Errors
- Validates file types and sizes
- Handles corrupted or invalid images
- Reports specific error messages

### Network Issues
- Graceful degradation when model files unavailable

- Clear status indicators for model state

## Performance Optimization

### Model Loading
- Loads once on component mount
- Caches model in memory for subsequent predictions
- Shows loading states and progress indicators

### Image Processing
- Resizes images to optimal model input size (224x224)
- Processes images in batches efficiently
- Uses canvas for client-side image manipulation

### User Experience
- Real-time feedback during analysis
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Clear success/error states

## Future Enhancements

### Model Improvements
